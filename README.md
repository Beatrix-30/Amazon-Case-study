## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing, and transforming product and customer review data meticulously scraped from Amazon product pages into actionable intelligence. Our core mission is to generate comprehensive insights that will empower businesses to:
 - Enhance Product Offerings: Identify product strengths and weaknesses, uncover emerging trends, and pinpoint opportunities for innovation and improvement based on direct customer feedback.
 - Inform Marketing Strategies: Optimize targeting, refine messaging, and develop more effective campaigns by understanding customer preferences, pain points, and purchase drivers.
 - Improve Customer Engagement: Foster stronger customer relationships through a deeper understanding of their needs, leading to enhanced satisfaction and loyalty.
By leveraging the rich tapestry of Amazon data, this repository aims to be a valuable resource for data-driven decision-making in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.

## üìÅ Data source
 - Amazon Case Study.xlsx [Download Here](https://canvas.instructure.com/files/302721266/download?download_frd=1)

   **Dataset Description**
   The dataset consists of essential information about products and customer interactions, including:
     - Product Details: Name, category, price, discount, and ratings
     - Customer Engagement: User reviews, titles, and content

## üß∞ **Tools used**
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://microsoft-excel.en.softonic.com/)
  - Power Query Editor 
  - Pivot Tables
  - Calculated Columns
  - Charts (Bar, Column, Combo)

## Data Transformation Process
After downloading the raw data, several crucial steps were taken to clean and prepare it for analysis on Microsoft Excel. This ensured data integrity and facilitated more insightful findings:
- Duplicate Removal: To maintain data uniqueness, duplicate entries were identified and removed. Duplicates were eliminated based product name, ensuring that each row represents a unique product.
- Text Cleaning and Formatting: Within the Power Query Editor, text data underwent significant cleaning:
   - Excessive spacing was trimmed from words to ensure consistency and improve readability.
   - Spaces were then inserted into concatenated words to format the data appropriately (e.g., "Home&Kitchen" became "Home & Kitchen").
- Product Recategorization: For enhanced analysis, products were reclassified into a new, simplified column called **'Product Category'**  using a delimiter =LEFT(C2, FIND("|", C2) - 1). For example, a category like "Computers & Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals" might be simplified to "Computers & Accessories" within the new 'Product Category' column.  
- Price Range Creation: A new column, 'Price Range', was introduced to categorize products based on their price. This was achieved using the following IF function. This formula automatically assigns each product to a predefined price bracket, allowing for a more granular analysis of pricing tiers.
